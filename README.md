# Library

This is a web page that allows users to create a personal book library. Users can enter the title, author, number of pages, and select whether they have read the book or not. The entered book details are displayed in a table, where users can also mark books as read or not read, as well as remove books from the library.

## Usage

To use the Book Library, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will see the library interface with input fields to add new books and a table to display the existing books.

- Fill in the input fields with the relevant information for the book you want to add.
- Select the "Read" radio button if you have read the book, or the "Not Read" radio button if you haven't.
- Click the "Save" button to add the book to your library.
- The table below will show all the books you have added, including their title, author, number of pages, read status, and an option to remove the book from the library.
- You can update the read status of a book by clicking on the "Read" or "Not Read" label in the table.
- To remove a book from the library, click on the "Remove" link in the table.
